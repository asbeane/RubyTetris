Notes to Build the Tetris Board Reader in Ruby
----------------------------------------------

 -Board Class - takes in X by Y shape -- each value would be a CELL - Where a piece could be located
 	- Output to command line .. OR use Graphics Library ...

 	- Board Class should

 - Shape/Piece Class
 	- Have a description of each shape
 	- Function to identify if a given piece exists...

- Two questions - Piece overlap - I am assuming it's not allowed
- Graphical ... or command line .... we'll see.

Create Game Class .. or maybe just main function depending on what appears to be easier
	- Game class should generate the board with random configuration --- Put limits on size of board (Only for generating the view of the board.


Piece - Parent Class
	- Initialize a piece with an orientation - orientation can be 0,90,180,270
		- You can call flip function which will simply change the orientation
		- Each piece has it's own inherited class .. OR do I even need that.
		- MAYBE I should pass a description of the piece .... and flip it on that ..
			- OR I can just make a class that has the four orientations for each ...
		- Each class needs to be able to find itself in each Orientation ...
